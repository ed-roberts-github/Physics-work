# Physics-work

Repo containing some of my projects to simulate physical situations to help me gain a better intuition.

I did most of these projects in c++. I have uploaded .cc files that contain the entire program however when I first coded them I usually split them all up into headfiles, function files and main(). I've uploaded the files as full programs just because it makes the compliing command easier.
